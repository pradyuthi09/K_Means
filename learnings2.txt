Hierarchical Clustering:
           
step1:For each point initially we will consider a seperate cluster
step2:Find the nearest point and create a new cluster
step3:keep on doing the process step2 until we get a single cluster
step4:Make a full big cluster 👉 Dendrogram (cluster tree)


A dendrogram is a tree diagram showing how clusters are formed.

Key Idea:

You draw a horizontal line across the dendrogram →
The number of branches cut = number of clusters.

So unlike K-Means:

K-Means → you give K first
Hierarchical → you choose K later



*************************************************************************************
Types of Hierarchical Clustering:

1.Agglomerative:
                 👉 Also called Bottom-Up approach

      Working:

           1.Start with each data point as its own cluster
           2.Find the two closest points
           3. Merge them
           4.Again find closest clusters
           5.Repeat until all points become one big cluster

2.Divisive:
            👉 Also called Top-Down approach
   
    Working:

           1.Start with all data points in one cluster
           2.Split into 2 clusters
           3.Split again
           4.Continue splitting


***************************************************************************************************
LINKAGE:

#Linkage used for the distance between two clustering


1.Single Linkage -	nearest points/min distance
2.Complete Linkage -	farthest points/max distance
3.Average Linkage -	average distance
4 Ward Method - minimizes variance (most used in ML) ⭐

     It merges clusters such that increase in variance (error) is minimum.

     Instead of measuring distance directly, it checks:

     “If I merge these two clusters, how much will the cluster spread increase?”

     It chooses the merge with least increase in variance.

***************************************************************************************************

problem:Combining different clusterings as a group with differnt data solved by dendogram to find out how many clustering in dataset
sol:  Instead of forcing clusters immediately, it:
      builds clusters gradually.
      It keeps merging similar data step-by-step and records every merge.
      That record becomes the Dendrogram.

      👉 “These two groups were similar enough, so they were merged.”

        The height of the merge is VERY IMPORTANT.

        Low height → very similar data

        High height → very different data


        process:  Hierarchical clustering will:(use euclidean distance)

                  First join points inside A,Then inside B,Then inside C ,MUCH later → join A with B or C

*******************************************************************************************************

Threshold technique:
       After hierarchical clustering, we get a dendrogram (tree diagram).
Now the problem:

Where should we stop merging clusters?

We solve this using a threshold value (cut-off distance).

A threshold is simply a horizontal line drawn across the dendrogram.the line is the longest line 
below wich no horizontal lines should be passed and on longest line draw a horizontal line middle on how many
points it passes it is the number of clusters

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What the Threshold Means

It is a maximum allowed distance (dissimilarity) between data points inside a cluster.

If two groups merge below the threshold → they are similar → keep them in same cluster

If they merge above the threshold → they are too different → separate clusters

#Cosine similairty:-

Cosine similarity measures how similar two data objects are based on the angle between them, not their actual distance.

Imagine two arrows (vectors):

pointing same direction → very similar

90° angle → unrelated

opposite direction → completely different
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: 
Euclidean = distance(says different)
Cosine = direction(says similar)
